# TooManyCooks
Too Many Cooks is a game that mimics Overcooked but with a zombie twist. As a player, you must manage your resources and 
fend off against zombies that're both trying to harm you and your foods all the while cooking and serving customers. 

## Why did we build this game? 
We completed the project for our game-design course here at UC Berkeley. I built this game alongside 3 other developers 
and was primarily responsible for in-game interactions such as cutting ingredients and attacking enemies. 

## How long did this game take to build?
We built this game over the course of two months. We had a fundamental understanding of Unity and C# at that point but still 
had a lot to figure out. We divided the tasks, finished and demo-ed our project by the end of the semester (Spring 2019). 

# How can I play this game?
